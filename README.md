#Web-based collaborative drawing made modern, with Meteor.js for </div>blazing-fast communication

<p><span style="color:#1b96c6;">A bunch of us are putting together a web-based drawing app with games, hookers and blackjack. You simply draw (or chat or game) in real-time with others in the same space. Plenty of these are done in Flash, but we&#39;re making it happen in&nbsp;</span><span style="color:#4f6b99;"><strong>JavaScript</strong></span><span style="color:#1b96c6;">, </span><span style="color:#4f6b99;"><strong>MeteorJS</strong></span><span style="color:#1b96c6;">, and </span><span style="color:#4f6b99;"><strong>HTML5&nbsp;</strong></span><span style="color:#1b96c6;">&ndash; a site that works on mobile (because it&#39;s not Flash)&nbsp;for anybody to screw and play around on or intently draw.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#4f6b99;">Current drawing apps aren&#39;t too popular as they are not accessible to the host of many devices people use, chatting&#39;s not versatile or user-friendly enough to rival chat sites, and their designs look god-awful like it&#39;s still the 90&#39;s. So with what we&#39;re after, there&#39;s insane potential here.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#4f6b99;">This is the interface. I hope it gives you some sense of what we&#39;re aspiring for. It&#39;s predominantly </span><span style="color:#1b96c6;"><strong>JS</strong></span><span style="color:#4f6b99;">, </span><span style="color:#1b96c6;"><strong>HTML</strong></span><span style="color:#4f6b99;">, </span><span style="color:#1b96c6;"><strong>CSS</strong></span><span style="color:#4f6b99;"> with server-user communication in WebSockets (though WebRTC support could be nice in future).</span><span style="color:#4f6b99;">&nbsp;If you&#39;re good with any of these and want to help the team / ask anything, message user DrawPlanet, Skype </span><span style="color:#1b96c6;"><strong>drawplanet</strong></span><span style="color:#4f6b99;"> or email </span><a href="mailto:form@drawplanet.net?subject=Real-Time%20Drawing%20Project"><span style="color:#1b96c6;">form@drawplanet.net</span></a><span style="color:#4f6b99;">. Will be more than happy to answer any of your questions. And if you&#39;re critical of anything, nothing&#39;s set in stone. It&#39;s very much a <em>by the community, for the community</em> type of project.<br><br>Did I mention it's not Flash?</span></p>
